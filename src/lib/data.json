                "question": "How quickly can you respond to emergency AC repairs?",
                "answer": "We offer 24/7 emergency AC repair services and typically respond within 1-2 hours of your call. Our emergency technicians are equipped with common parts and tools to resolve most issues on the first visit. We understand that AC failures can be critical, especially during extreme weather conditions, so we prioritize emergency calls to restore your comfort as quickly as possible."

                "question": "What's included in your annual maintenance plans?",
                "answer": "Our comprehensive annual maintenance plans include bi-annual system inspections, filter replacements, coil cleaning, refrigerant level checks, electrical connection inspections, thermostat calibration, and priority scheduling for repairs. Members also receive 15% discounts on parts and labor, extended warranties, and free emergency service calls. Regular maintenance can extend your system's lifespan by up to 40% and improve energy efficiency significantly."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do I know if I need AC repair or replacement?",
                "answer": "Consider replacement if your AC is over 10-15 years old, requires frequent repairs, has rising energy bills, or struggles to maintain comfortable temperatures. Signs you need repair include unusual noises, weak airflow, warm air from vents, frequent cycling, or moisture around the unit. Our technicians provide honest assessments and will recommend the most cost-effective solution. We offer free consultations to help you make the best decision for your situation and budget."
            },
            {
                "question": "Do you provide warranties on your work and parts?",
                "answer": "Yes, we provide comprehensive warranties on all our work. Labor warranties range from 1-2 years depending on the service, while parts warranties vary by manufacturer (typically 5-10 years for major components). New system installations come with extended warranties up to 10 years on parts and 2 years on labor. We also offer extended warranty options for additional peace of mind. All warranty terms are clearly explained before any work begins."
            },
            {
                "question": "What factors affect the cost of AC installation?",
                "answer": "AC installation costs depend on several factors: system size and efficiency rating, type of unit (central air, ductless, etc.), existing ductwork condition, electrical requirements, installation complexity, and local permits. Higher efficiency units cost more upfront but save money long-term through reduced energy bills. We provide detailed, transparent quotes that break down all costs. Our financing options make quality installations affordable with flexible payment plans."
            },
            {
                "question": "How often should I change my AC filters?",
                "answer": "Standard 1-inch filters should be changed every 1-3 months, depending on usage, pets, and air quality. Thicker pleated filters (4-5 inches) can last 6-12 months. Check filters monthly - if they look dirty or clogged, replace them immediately. Dirty filters reduce efficiency, increase energy costs, and can damage your system. We can set up automatic filter delivery services and provide reminders to help you maintain optimal system performance."
            },
            {
                "question": "Are your technicians licensed and insured?",
                "answer": "Absolutely. All our technicians are fully licensed, bonded, and insured. They undergo continuous training to stay current with the latest HVAC technologies and safety protocols. Our company carries comprehensive liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage. We can provide proof of licensing and insurance upon request. Our technicians also wear uniforms and carry photo identification for your security and peace of mind."
